                <p>
                    Here are some mods I recommend to get started:
                </p>

                <h2 class="heading">Downloading Mods</h2>
                <p>This can differ slightly depending on where you get your mods from. These are the instructions for the places I normally download from.</p>
                <h3>Nexus Mods</h3>
                <p>
                    On the page for the mod you want, first click Manual next to download options.
                    <img src="images/nexus options.png" alt="A row of buttons. The first four read add media, track, endorse, and vote. To the right there is text that says Download: and next to that are two buttons that say vortex and manual respectively."><br>
                    There may be a popup that tells you that additional files are required. If you have already downloaded these you can ignore this and press download. Otherwise you can either open these links in new tabs to download after or you can download now and then go back to the requirements after.<br>
                    The popup looks like this:<br>
                    <img src="images/dsv pt2.png" alt="A popup from Nexus Mods saying additional files are required for the mod to run. It warns that you need other files installed before running the mod and lists the mods as hyperlinks.In the bottom left corner there is an orange download button."><br>
                    And the mod requirements are found here and look like this:<br>
                    <img src="images/dsv pt5.png" alt="A screenshot of the description tab on Nexus Mods. The screenshot includes the other tabs, the about, and the requirements and permissions dropdown menus.">
                    <img src="images/dsv pt6.png" alt="The requirements table on Nexus Mods. It lists the mods required and notes about them, and in a seperate table lists the mods that require this mod."><br>
                    Some additional mods are optional depending on what you do with the mod, such as the Sprites in Detail mod shown above.<br>
                    The download button will take you to this page with the option for fast or slow download.<br>
                    <img src="images/dsv pt3.png" alt="A table comparing free and premium download types. At teh bottom there are buttons that say slow download and fast download."><br>
                    Fast download requires paying Nexus money and most mods are small enough that the fast download speed is unnecessary. For the few larger mods, such as DSV or SMAPI, you just need some patience.<br>
                    There may be a 5 second wait before your download begins but once it starts you can continue downloading other mods or move onto installing.<br>
                    <img src="images/dsv pt4.png" alt="Text reading &quot;Your download has started. If you are having trouble, click here to download manually.&quot;">
                </p>
                <h3>ModDrop</h3>
                <p>
                    Underneath the title of the mod there will be these buttons, click download.<br>
                    <img src="images/moddrop pt1.png" alt="Three purple buttons reading Install with ModDrop, Download, and Options respectively."><br>
                    There may be a dropdown menu with different options, if you know which version you need you can select that from the list, if not click see all versions.<br>
                    <img src="images/moddrop pt 1.5.png" alt=""><br>
                    This is what the all files menu looks like. To select a version click on the title.<br>
                    <img src="images/moddrop pt2.png" alt=""><br>
                    You may have a popup when you select a file. The file will begin downloading when you click okay.<br>
                    <img src="images/moddrop pt3.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <h3>Github</h3>
                <p>
                    On Github just click on the zip file and it will begin downloading.<br>
                    <img src="images/uiis pt1.png" alt="">

            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">Updating Mods</h2>
                <p>
                    Follow the same instructions for downloading, then go to your mods folder and delete the old version of the mod before following the installation instructions. If the mod contains a lot of customisations, such as Diverse Stardew Valley, consider creating a copy of the config.json file so you can transfer the data easily.
